[recheck](https://github.com/retest/recheck) for logs. Replace manual asserts and check everything at once.


## Features

* Easy creation and maintenance of checks for logs.
* Semantic comparison of contents.
* Easily ignore formatting, volatile elements, attributes or sections.
* One-click maintenance to update tests with intended changes.
* No unexpected changes go unnoticed.


## Advantages

Instead of manually defining individual aspects that you want to check, check everything at once. So instead of writing lots of `assert`-statements (and still not have complete checks), write a single `re.check`. This saves a lot of effort when creating the tests. And makes sure to not [miss unexpected changes](https://hackernoon.com/assertions-considered-harmful-d3770d818054).

And even better: using the [retest GUI](https://retest.de/en/) (or the soon to come open source CLI), you can easily accept those changes with a single click (patent pending). This also saves a lot of time during maintenance. Any regular changing aspects or elements can easily be ignored.


## Usage

Download recheck-logs [latest release](https://github.com/retest/recheck-logs/releases/).

### Prerequisites

Currently available as a Java API with support for JUnit 4. 

Add any logging facility you want, that is compatible with [SLF4j](https://www.slf4j.org/).
